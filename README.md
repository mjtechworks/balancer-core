<h1 align=center><code>balancer</code></h1>

**Balancer** is an automated **portfolio manager**, **liquidity provider**, and **price sensor**.

Balancer turns the concept of an index fund on its head: instead of a paying fees
to portfolio managers to rebalance your portfolio, you collect fees from traders, who rebalance
your portfolio by following arbitrage opportunities.

Balancer is based on an N-dimensional invariant surface which is a generalization of the constant product formula described by Vitalik Buterin and proven viable by the popular Uniswap dapp.

The *🍂Bronze Release🍂*  is the first of 3 planned releases of the Balancer Protocol. Bronze emphasizes code clarity for audit and verification, and does not go to great lengths to optimize for gas.

The *❄️Silver Release❄️* will bring many gas optimizations and architecture changes that will reduce transaction overhead and enable more flexibility for managed pools.

The *☀️Golden Release☀️* will introduce a curious new liquidity mechanism to the market.
