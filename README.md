<h1 align=center><code>balancer</code></h1>

**Balancer** is an automated **portfolio manager**, **liquidity provider**, and **price sensor**.

Balancer turns the concept of an index fund on its head: instead of a paying fees
to portfolio managers to rebalance your portfolio, you collect fees from traders, who rebalance
your portfolio by following arbitrage opportunities.

Balancer is based on an N-dimensional invariant surface which is a generalization of the constant product formula described by Vitalik Buterin and proven viable by the popular Uniswap dapp.

<h2 align=center><br/><code>üçÇ bronze release üçÇ</code></h2>

The *üçÇBronze ReleaseüçÇ*  is the first of 3 planned releases of the Balancer Protocol. Bronze emphasizes code clarity for audit and verification, and does not go to great lengths to optimize for gas.

The *‚ùÑÔ∏èSilver Release‚ùÑÔ∏è* will bring many gas optimizations and architecture changes that will reduce transaction overhead and enable more flexibility for managed pools.

The *‚òÄÔ∏èGolden Release‚òÄÔ∏è* will introduce a curious new liquidity mechanism to the market.


### Using the ABI definitions

Most users will want to consume the ABI definitions for BFactory and BPool.

This project follows the standard Truffle project structure. 

```
yarn compile   # build artifacts to `build/contracts`
yarn testrpc # run ganache
yarn test    # run the tests
```

Some test cases give helpful example logs:

```
  Contract: math tests from canonical setup
pool := factory.newBPool()
dirt := tokens.build('DIRT')
rock := tokens.build('ROCK')
dirt.mint(MAX);
dirt.approve(POOL, MAX);
rock.mint(MAX);
rock.approve(POOL, MAX);
pool.bind(DIRT, 10000000000000000000, 1100000000000000000)
pool.bind(ROCK, 50000000000000000000, 2400000000000000000)
pool.setPublicSwap(true);
pool.setPublicJoin(true);
pool.rebind(DIRT, 10000000000000000000, 1100000000000000000)
pool.rebind(ROCK, 50000000000000000000, 2400000000000000000)
pool.swap_ExactAmountIn(DIRT, 2500000000000000000, ROCK, 0, MAX);
 -> ( 4860897990289925450 , 604192951531479606 )
    ‚úì swap_ExactAmountIn (336ms)
```
