Balancer is an automated portfolio manager, liquidity provider, and price sensor.

Balancer turns the concept of an index fund on its head: instead of an investors paying fees
to portfolio managers to rebalance their portfolio, investors *collect* fees from traders who rebalance
their portfolio by following arbitrage opportunities.

The *Bronze Release* is the first of 3 planned releases of the Balancer Protocol. Bronze could be described as solid, but heavyweight.

## Installing

Most users will be interested in consuming ABI definitions for various Balancer contracts.

At the moment, the best way to use it is as a git submodule.

```
mkdir lib
git submodule add https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-core lib/balancer-core
```

Now you can require the package:

```javascript
let bcore = require('./lib/balancer-core');
let types = bcore.types;  # A combined.json object with type names lifted
let BPool = bcore.types.BPool;
let bpool = new web3.eth.Contract(BPool.abi);
```

## Developing (working on `balancer-core`)

```
# To develop you need `yarn`, `node`, and `solc`
brew install node yarn ethereum

# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-core
cd balancer-core

# Get the dependencies
yarn setup       # clone submodules and install packages

# Dev loop
# yarn build       # compile the solidity contracts to tmp/  (`make build`)
yarn test        # build contracts and run the tests (`yarn build && mocha`)
yarn dist        # cp artifacts to out/ for commit (`make dist`)
```
